:star2: I am truly humbled and honoured to share that I have been selected for the <a href="https://womeninaiethics.org/">100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethicsâ„¢</a> award for 2024. It is a tremendous privilege to be acknowledged among such inspiring and talented women in AI Ethics, many of whom have been my role models since the very start of my career. I wish to recognise this as a reminder of the collective responsibility we share in creating technology that respects and upholds human dignity and rights and to lift and encourage those whose voices are often left unheard in this space.
