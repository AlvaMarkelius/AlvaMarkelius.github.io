I was so happy to be a guest at the University of Cambridge Student Podcast last week with the amazing Erica Lees-Smith and Annissa La Touche! We were chatting about AIethics, human rights, my work as President of Cambridge University AI Ethics Society and I got to speak a bit about my latest PhD research about robotics and disability. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZF0zKX1m9MteD0fUiiekL?si=3ede77b7aef945a2">Please give it a listen if you are interested!</a>
