I am a AI Ethics & Society MSt student at the Leverhulme Centre for the future of intelligence at the University of Cambridge. I am also a research assistant at the <a href="https://dice-r-lab.com/">DICE - lab</a> at the Institution for Applied IT, University of Gothenburg. Find my publications at my [publications page](/al-folio/publications/). 

My main research interests are the ethics of social AI and robotics, embodied cognition, affect and emotion, gender and intersectionality, global AI narratives and imaginaries.
