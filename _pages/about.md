I am an incoming PhD candidate and Cambridge Trust Scholar at the <a href="https://cambridge-afar.github.io/">Affective Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory (AFAR)</a>, Department of Computer Science, at the University of Cambridge and recipient of Top 100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethicsâ„¢ award 2024. I am also president of <a href="https://cuaiethics.com/">Cambridge University AI Ethics Society</a> - a student run society aimed at creating a space to critically explore how AI and emerging technologies can best secure and further the ideals of social justice and democracy at local, national, and international scales. Furthermore, I am part of the <a href="https://www.chia.cam.ac.uk/">Centre for Human Inspired AI</a> Early Career Community Committee, Oxbridge Chair of Women@CL committee, young leaders chair of <a href="https://icsr2024.dk/" >16th International Conference on Social Robotics 2024.</a> and student steward for <a href="https://betterimagesofai.org/" >Better Images of AI.</a>

My main research interests are the ethics of social AI and robotics, specifically in the intersection of embodied robotics and large language models. I am also interested in embodied cognition, affect and emotion, gender and intersectionality, global AI narratives and AI hype.

I obtained my MSt degree in AI Ethics & Society at the <a href= "http://lcfi.ac.uk/" >Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence</a> at the University of Cambridge while working as a research engineer at the <a href="https://dice-r-lab.com/">DICE - lab</a> at the Institution for Applied IT, University of Gothenburg. I received my bachelor degree in cognitive science at the University of Gothenburg and Seoul National University where I specialised in AI and robotics.
