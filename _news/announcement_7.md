I am very proud of how well received our recent paper on AI Hype has been, recently published in Springer AI and Ethics, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00461-2">The mechanisms of AI hype and its planetary and social costs</a>. Please give it a read, it is fully open access.
