I am organising the workshop <a href= "https://sites.google.com/view/llmra/start">Large Language Models in the RoMan Age: Exploring Social Impact and Implications for Design and Ethics</a> at the IEEE International Conference on Robot & Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN 2024) August 26, 2024 / Pasadena, CA. We will engage with questions arising at the intersection of LLMs and HRI, and in particular related to social impact, ethical considerations and design.
