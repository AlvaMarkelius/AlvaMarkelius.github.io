    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>I am a PhD candidate and Cambridge Trust Scholar at the <a href="https://cambridge-afar.github.io/">Affective Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory (AFAR)</a>, Department of Computer Science & Technology, University of Cambridge, and recipient of the Top 100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethics™ award 2024. I currently serve as committee chair of the <a href="https://www.chia.cam.ac.uk/">Centre for Human-Inspired AI</a> Early Career Community and as student steward for <a href="https://betterimagesofai.org/">Better Images of AI</a>.</p>

    <p>My main research interests lie in the ethics of social AI and robotics — particularly at the intersection of embodied robotics and large language models. I am also passionate about embodied cognition, affect and emotion, gender and intersectionality, global AI narratives, and the phenomenon of AI hype.</p>

    <p>I hold an MSt in AI Ethics & Society from the <a href="http://lcfi.ac.uk/">Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence</a> at the University of Cambridge. During that time I worked as a research engineer at the <a href="https://dice-r-lab.com/">DICE-lab</a>, Department of Applied IT, University of Gothenburg. I received my BSc in Cognitive Science from the University of Gothenburg and Seoul National University, specialising in AI and robotics.</p>

    <p>Beyond academia, I am Co-President of the <a href="https://www.cupoloclub.com/">Cambridge University Polo Club</a> and compete regularly with the Cambridge team.</p>
