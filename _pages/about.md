I am a PhD candidate and Cambridge Trust Scholar at the <a href="https://cambridge-afar.github.io/">Affective Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory (AFAR)</a>, Department of Computer Science & Technology, at the University of Cambridge and recipient of Top 100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethicsâ„¢ award 2024. Furthermore, I am committee chair of the <a href="https://www.chia.cam.ac.uk/">Centre for Human Inspired AI</a> Early Career Community and student steward for <a href="https://betterimagesofai.org/" >Better Images of AI.</a>

My main research interests are the ethics of social AI and robotics, specifically in the intersection of embodied robotics and large language models. I am also interested in embodied cognition, affect and emotion, gender and intersectionality, global AI narratives and AI hype.

I obtained my MSt degree in AI Ethics & Society at the <a href= "http://lcfi.ac.uk/" >Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence</a> at the University of Cambridge while working as a research engineer at the <a href="https://dice-r-lab.com/">DICE - lab</a> at the Institution for Applied IT, University of Gothenburg. I received my bachelor degree in cognitive science at the University of Gothenburg and Seoul National University where I specialised in AI and robotics. 

I am also Co-President of the <a href= "https://www.cupoloclub.com/" >Cambridge University Polo Club</a> and active as a competative player in the Cambridge team.
