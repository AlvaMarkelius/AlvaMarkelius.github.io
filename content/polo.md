### Polo

![Varis](/polo-action.jpg){.portrait}

I'm a passionate polo player with X years of experience.  
I currently play at [Club Name] in [City/Country], handicap +3 (or whatever yours is), riding a string of Argentine horses.  
Polo has taught me discipline, teamwork under pressure, and the joy of 90 km/h decision-making on horseback.
