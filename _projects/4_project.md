The project developed and validated the 2nd generation of Danish company's <a href="https://www.brain-plus.com/">Brain+ </a> Computerized Cognitive Training which is being developed using a novel mechanism of action (Differentual Outcomes Training) ultimately to be an intervention for people with Mild Cognitive Impairment. Differential Outcomes Training is based on mechanisms that utilize memory routes that are less affected in dementia, this method has proven effective for facilitating medium to high learning effects in people with Alzheimer’s disease, both in the phases of Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia.

I was part of carrying out feasibility pilot studies of a functional prototype of the visuospatial memory training task at the University of Gothenburg. The research aimed to examine both usability and to collect biometric data to inform future studies of factors such as engagement and memorisation strategies.
