<p>
  The I-AIMS project is a collaboration between <a href="https://dice-r-lab.com/">DICE - lab</a> and Smarteye and seeks to explore ways to improve the safety and well-being of drivers. The research is focused on ethical integration of combining a Driver Monitoring System (DMS) and Large Language Models (LLM) to give warnings or advice when the system notices the driver is fatigued, stressed, or experiencing negative emotions. The effectiveness of the combined DMS and LLM system is investigated with a particular focus on relevance and appropriateness of the feedback and ethical considerations. The long term aim is to further develop the LLM's integration with the DMS and perhaps using a robotic head unit installed in the vehicle to deliver the feedback and as a driver social companion. This unit will be capable of showing emotional expressions and interacting with drivers at appropriate and safe times, with two degrees of freedom for interaction.
