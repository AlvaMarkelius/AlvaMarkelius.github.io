Hon jobbar också extra i ett labb där man forskar inom robotik, VR och interaktionen mellan människa och robot. För Alva är det viktigt att använda AI-tekniken rätt och i framtiden vill hon jobba för en arbetsgivare som har en förankring i både forskning och industri, gärna i en internationell miljö. Hon vill också jobba vidare med etiska aspekter och riktlinjer för teknik.
